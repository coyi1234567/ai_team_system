1. **Multi-Level Approval**:
   - Establish a definitive approval workflow that includes roles such as department managers, HR representatives, and CEO.
   - Define time limits for each approval tier, particularly for urgent leave requests.
   - Implement an approval feedback mechanism with automated reminders to enhance processing efficiency.

2. **Permission Management**:
   - Clearly define roles and permissions for employees, managers, and administrators, utilizing a combination of RBAC and ABAC for access control.
   - Design a dynamic permission system to accommodate internal personnel changes, allowing for quick updates based on role adjustments.
   - Conduct regular audits of permission settings to mitigate the risk of abuse.

3. **Leave Record Query**:
   - Create an interface that allows users to query leave records by reason, duration, and status.
   - Ensure the functionality supports exporting data in various formats (CSV, XLSX, PDF) and includes filtering and sorting options.
   - Optimize the query performance by integrating caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) and support for pagination and lazy loading.

4. **Mobile Adaptation**:
   - Identify the most commonly used mobile devices and operating systems by the target user group to ensure compatibility.
   - Conduct market research and user experience testing to gather feedback on design prototypes.
   - Implement responsive design principles to provide a seamless experience across different device types.

5. **RAG Knowledge Base**:
   - Develop a structured knowledge base that serves as a quick reference for employees regarding leave policies and FAQs.
   - Create a process for regular updates and reviews of the knowledge base content to ensure accuracy and relevance.
   - Consider interactive functionalities to address common queries through the knowledge base.

6. **MCP Protocol Integration**:
   - Familiarize the development team with the specific requirements and standards outlined in the MCP protocol and associated documentation.
   - Investigate existing SDKs or APIs available for MCP to expedite integration efforts and reduce development time.

7. **Automated Deployment**:
   - Utilize CI/CD tools (like Jenkins or GitLab CI) to streamline the deployment process, minimizing human error.
   - Clearly outline environment configurations and dependencies needed during deployment to ensure a smooth rollout.
   - Draft a rollback plan to effectively manage potential deployment failures and maintain system reliability.

This comprehensive plan addresses the key components necessary for developing the employee leave management application, ensuring both usability and efficiency for users and administrators alike.
