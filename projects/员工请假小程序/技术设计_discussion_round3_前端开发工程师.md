Here is a comprehensive summary of the project requirements and insights for the employee leave management system based on the discussions from the team:

1. **Multi-level Approval:**
   - Establish a multi-tiered approval workflow involving key personnel such as department managers, HR, and the CEO.
   - Clearly define processing timelines for each approval level, particularly for urgent leave requests, ensuring timely responses to minimize disruption.
   - Introduce a notification system to alert approvers of pending requests, enhancing operational efficiency.

2. **Permissions Management:**
   - Implement a dual framework combining Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) to cater to varying permissions requirements across roles and departments.
   - Design a dynamic permissions management system that adapts to changes in personnel or organizational structure, allowing permissions to be updated as necessary.

3. **Leave Record Query Functionality:**
   - Develop a user-friendly interface to allow employees to track leave history, including reasons, dates, and statuses.
   - Implement features such as filtering, sorting, and exporting records in multiple formats (CSV, PDF, XLSX) to improve data accessibility and usability.
   - Utilize pagination and lazy loading techniques to enhance performance when handling large datasets.

4. **Mobile Device Adaptation:**
   - Conduct user research to determine the most commonly used devices (smartphones, tablets) and operating systems (iOS, Android) within the organization.
   - Optimize the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) for mobile access, ensuring responsive design across various screen sizes while maintaining key functionalities.
   - Plan usability testing to identify and resolve issues early in the development process.

5. **RAG Knowledge Base:**
   - Establish a structured RAG (Red, Amber, Green) knowledge base to provide employees with quick access to relevant information regarding leave policies and procedures.
   - Design a maintenance mechanism for regularly updating the knowledge base, potentially integrating user feedback to assess and enhance content relevance continuously.
   - Implement features that allow users to submit common queries and questions, leading to intelligent content recommendations based on historical search data.

6. **MCP Protocol Integration:**
   - Conduct in-depth research on MCP protocol requirements for integration and ensure comprehensive documentation is available to guide development efforts.
   - Leverage existing SDKs or APIs provided by MCP protocol vendors to streamline development and bolster system security.
   - Schedule a technical review session with the development team to confirm aligned understanding of protocol standards.

7. **Automated Deployment:**
   - Identify appropriate CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) tools (like Jenkins or GitLab CI) that match the projectâ€™s needs.
   - Break down the deployment process into simplified stages (development, testing, production) with clearly defined configurations and dependencies.
   - Formulate rollback plans to minimize impacts during deployment failures.

By addressing these areas comprehensively, we will ensure the successful and timely delivery of the employee leave management system, which aligns with user needs while meeting business objectives for operational efficiency and enhanced user experience.
