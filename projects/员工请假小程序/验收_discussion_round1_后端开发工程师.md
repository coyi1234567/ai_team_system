The employee leave management system is designed to streamline and enhance the management of leave requests within an organization. 

### Key Requirements:

1. **Multi-Level Approval**:
   - Establish a hierarchical approval structure involving various stakeholders such as department managers, HR, and the CEO.
   - Define processing time limits for each approval tier, notably for urgent leave scenarios.
   - Integrate a feedback mechanism for approvals and automated reminders to improve responsiveness.

2. **Permission Management**:
   - Clearly define the specific permissions for different roles (employees, managers, administrators).
   - Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) combined with Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) to facilitate flexible and dynamic permissions.
   - Conduct periodic reviews of permissions to prevent abuse and ensure compliance with organizational changes.

3. **Leave Record Query**:
   - Allow users to query leave records based on reasons, dates, and approval status.
   - Support data exports in various formats (CSV, XLSX, PDF) and incorporate filtering and sorting capabilities for improved usability.
   - Optimize query performance by potentially integrating caching solutions (e.g., Redis) and enabling pagination for large data sets.

4. **Mobile Adaptation**:
   - Confirm compatibility across various mobile devices and their operating systems (iOS, Android), ensuring the application provides a seamless user experience.
   - Conduct user experience testing and market research to gather feedback for design iterations.
   - Apply responsive design principles throughout the development to guarantee usability on all device types.

5. **RAG Knowledge Base**:
   - Create a structured knowledge base containing frequently asked questions and policy information related to leave applications to assist employees.
   - Design a maintenance system to keep knowledge base content up-to-date with current policies and practices, supported by a designated maintainer.
   - Optionally provide an interactive component for common inquiries, enhancing usability.

6. **MCP Protocol Integration**:
   - Fully understand the MCP protocol standards, identifying and documenting necessary API endpoints for integration.
   - Explore existing SDKs or APIs that might facilitate a quicker and more efficient integration process.

7. **Automated Deployment**:
   - Utilize CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI) to ensure smooth and efficient automated deployment procedures.
   - Clearly define environmental configurations and dependencies to minimize deployment risks and simplify the process.
   - Create a rollback plan to address potential deployment failures and maintain service continuity.

### Conclusion:
This structured approach not only addresses the functional requirements of the employee leave management system but also emphasizes the importance of performance optimization, secure access control, and user experience. Effective implementation will lead to a robust, user-friendly system that efficiently manages employee leave while providing administrators with necessary oversight and control.
