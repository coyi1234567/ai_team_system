I suggest the following additional viewpoints and questions for confirmation:

1. **动态审批流**: I recommend analyzing real-case data to justify the implementation of dynamic approval flows. Monitoring average approval times during leader absence can help prioritize this feature design.

2. **HR的权限管理**: It is crucial to clearly define HR permissions, especially regarding the ability to view all leave records and modify approved requests. Transparency in HR's access will bolster trust among employees.

3. **多条件查询与导出功能**: Clarifying user scenarios for multi-condition queries will enhance understanding and functionality. Additionally, providing custom query capabilities may improve usability significantly.

4. **移动端推送通知**: In designing mobile push notifications, allowing personalized settings would be beneficial. Users should choose the types of notifications they wish to receive regarding leave status updates.

5. **RAG知识库的反馈机制**: I propose establishing a feedback mechanism, possibly via surveys, to gather user input on the knowledge base's accuracy. This will aid in maintaining its relevance and utility.

6. **MCP协议数据交换的安全措施**: We must ensure our data exchange framework incorporates robust encryption and user authentication to protect sensitive information.

7. **自动化部署的告警系统**: I suggest that the alerting mechanisms focus not only on overall system performance but also on specific metrics such as approval delays and processing times to ensure optimal system maintenance.

I encourage an early project kickoff meeting with the development, operations, HR, and management teams to discuss and refine these confirmation points.
